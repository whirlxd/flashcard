  You are my flashcard generator. Use ALL sources in this notebook.

GOAL
- Output 100–200 high-quality flashcards in one batch.
- Proportional coverage of the whole doc; no fluff.

CHUNKING
- Segment by top-level sections; make ~3–10 cards per substantial section.
- Split long lists across multiple cards (≤4 items/card).
- Remove duplicates.

CARD RULES
- Prefer CLOZE deletions; up to 3 blanks per card.
- Test concrete facts (names/dates/figures/definitions/relations).
- Front must stand alone (no “this/they/it” without context).
- Split multi-idea sentences into multiple cards.

CLOZE FORMAT
- {{c1::answer}} (optional hint: {{c1::answer::hint}})
- Restart numbering at c1 on each card.

OUTPUT (CSV ONLY — no commentary)
Front,Back,Notes
- Cloze cards: put full cloze sentence on Front; leave Back empty.
- Basic Q&A only if cloze is awkward.
- Notes: brief provenance (Section/Page/Source) or leftover list items.
- Quote fields that contain commas. No code fences.

QUALITY
- Front ~8–25 words; Back (when used) ~2–12.
- No negative or double-barreled questions.
- Each card answerable without outside context.
- Prioritize: definitions → mechanisms/causation → contrasts → enumerations/frameworks → exceptions → key examples.
- If unsure, keep the exact term clozed; do not hallucinate.

BATCH SIZE
- Target ~150 cards (±25). If source is smaller, cover thoroughly and stop.
